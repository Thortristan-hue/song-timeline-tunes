# Host Visual Feedback Test Plan

## Test Objective
Verify that host visual animations provide clear feedback for player guesses while keeping player view animations unaffected.

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Host View Feedback
**Setup:** Open game as host in one browser window
**Actions:**
1. Start a game and wait for a player to join
2. When player makes a correct guess, observe host screen
3. When player makes an incorrect guess, observe host screen

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Correct guess: Green checkmark appears in center, sparkle effects, green corner indicator
- ❌ Incorrect guess: Red X appears in center, red pulse effects, red corner indicator  
- Host feedback should be prominent and clearly visible
- Feedback should last ~6 seconds total (4s modal + 2s extra feedback)

### Test 2: Player View Isolation  
**Setup:** Open game as player in mobile browser
**Actions:**
1. Join a game and make correct/incorrect guesses
2. Observe that only standard player animations occur

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Player sees their own placement animations only
- ❌ No host-specific feedback (green checkmarks, sparkles, corner indicators) on player view
- Player animations remain unchanged and functional

### Test 3: Animation Timing
**Setup:** Host view during active game
**Actions:**
1. Track timing of host feedback animations
2. Ensure animations don't interfere with game flow

**Expected Results:**
- Host feedback appears immediately when player places card
- Modal shows for 4 seconds
- Additional host feedback continues for 2 more seconds
- No blocking of next turn or game progression

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Host Feedback Features:
1. **Visual Indicators:**
   - Central checkmark (✓) for correct guesses
   - Central X mark (✗) for incorrect guesses
   - Enhanced sparkle/pulse effects
   - Corner notification badges

2. **Animation Improvements:**
   - More prominent CSS animations
   - Extended feedback duration for host awareness
   - Better visual contrast and brightness changes

3. **View Isolation:**
   - `showHostFeedback={false}` in MobilePlayerGameView
   - Host feedback only in HostGameView components
   - Separate feedback systems prevent cross-contamination

### Code Changes Made:
- Enhanced `HostFeedbackOverlay` component with better visual feedback
- Improved CSS animations for `host-feedback-correct` and `host-feedback-incorrect`
- Extended host feedback duration (6 seconds total vs 4 seconds)
- Added safety comments to ensure proper view separation
