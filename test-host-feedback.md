# Enhanced Host Visual Feedback - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved
Reworked the animations to ensure that host visuals are updated for better player feedback without affecting the player view animations.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Host Visual Animations
- **Prominent Feedback**: Central checkmark (✓) for correct guesses, X mark (✗) for incorrect guesses
- **Corner Indicators**: Persistent "Correct!" and "Try Again!" badges visible only to host
- **Enhanced Effects**: Improved sparkle animations for success, pulse effects for errors
- **Extended Duration**: 6-second feedback (4s modal + 2s additional) for better host awareness
- **Better CSS**: Enhanced animations with improved brightness, scale, and visual impact

### Player View Protection
- **Complete Isolation**: `showHostFeedback={false}` in `MobilePlayerGameView` prevents feedback leakage
- **Safety Comments**: Added explicit comments to prevent future cross-contamination
- **Unchanged Experience**: Player animations remain exactly as before
